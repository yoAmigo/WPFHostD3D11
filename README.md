# WPFHostD3D11
This program made in the following two steps by visual studio 2017.
1. make Win32 Execution Project, and then program simple d3d-drawing by vertex&pixel shader.
2. make wpf(C#) project hosting native window handle(HWND).
at this time, change step-1's execution project to cli-classlibrary.
and then, add reference for the cli-classlibrary to wpf(C#) project.
